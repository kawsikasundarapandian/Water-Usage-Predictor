# Water-Usage-Predictor
“A Python-based tool that forecasts daily water requirements for crops using weather simulation and growth stage multipliers. Includes safety tips, irrigation alerts, CSV reports, and Tamil translation support.”
 Advanced Water Usage Predictor  
Smart irrigation system powered by Python — forecasts weekly water requirements for crops using weather simulation and AI logic.

 Project Overview:
 
This project helps farmers and agricultural students estimate daily and weekly water usage for crops such as Wheat, Rice, and Maize.  
It uses simulated weather data (temperature, rainfall, humidity) and growth stage multipliers to calculate accurate irrigation requirements.

The program also generates CSV reports, text alerts, and Tamil translations for better accessibility.

 Features:
- Predicts 7-day water requirements for selected crops  
- Calculates using growth stage (Seedling, Vegetative, Flowering, Harvest)  
- Displays irrigation and safety alerts  
- Exports forecast to CSV and TXT reports  
- Translates results into Tamil using Deep Translator  
- Provides “Tip of the Day” and random weather-based advice  

Technologies Used:
- Python  
- tabulate  
- deep_translator  
- csv  
- datetime  
- random
